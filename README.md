# Udacity-TV-Script-Generation

## About
In this project we will be looking at a way to generate TV Script using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model will make use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to look at previous few words and accordingly it will predict the next word which will again act as an input while predicting the next word.

## How to use
1) Download/Clone the GitHub repository
2) Open the 'dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb' file.
3) Follow the instructions provided in the notebook and run all the cells in the notebook.

NOTE : Use of GPUs is highly recommended during training process
